**What Is Braiding?**

Braiding crosses each strand of hair over the other two strands to form a woven pattern. It can be done with either all-natural hair or with extensions. There are many ways to braid hair, including French braids, Dutch braids, and fishtail braids.

Braiding is a great way to keep hair looking neat and tidy, and it can also be used to create styles like waterfall braids or crown braids. Braiding also helps to prevent hair from becoming tangled or matted.

**3 Basic Braiding Techniques**

Here are three basic braiding techniques that everyone should know:

**1\. The Three-Strand Braid**

A three-strand braid is the most basic type of braid. It is created by taking three strands of hair and crossing them over each other in a repeating pattern.

To do a basic three-strand braid, follow these steps:

*   Begin with three sections of hair, each about the same thickness.
    
*   Cross the right strand over the middle strand.
    
*   Cross the left over the new middle strand (now the right strand).
    
*   Continue crossing the strands over each other in this pattern until you reach the end of the hair.
    
*   Secure the braid with a hair tie or clip.
    

**2\. The Fishtail Braid**

A fishtail braid is a more intricate version of the three-strand braid. It is created by taking two sections of hair and crossing them over each other in an alternating pattern.

To do a basic fishtail braid, follow these steps:

*   Start with two sections of hair, each about the same thickness.
    
*   Cross the right strand over the left strand.
    
*   Cross the left over the new right strand (now the left strand).
    
*   Alternate crossing the strands in this pattern until you reach the end of the hair.
    
*   Secure the braid with a hair tie or clip.
    

**3\. The French Braid**

A French braid is a more complex version of the three-strand braid. It is created by taking three sections of hair and braiding them together in a repeating pattern, adding new sections as you go.

To do a basic French braid, follow these steps:

*   Start with three sections of hair, each about the same thickness.
    
*   Cross the right strand over the middle strand.
    
*   Cross the left over the new middle strand (now the right strand).
    
*   Add a small section of hair to the right strand and cross it over the new middle strand.
    
*   Add a small section of hair to the left strand and cross it over the new middle strand.
    
*   Continue crossing the strands over each other and adding new sections of hair until you reach the end of the hair.
    
*   Secure the braid with a hair tie or clip.
    

There are many variations of these basic braiding techniques. Once you have mastered these basics, you can start experimenting with different looks.
